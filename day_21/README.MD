# Day 21: Advanced Snake Game

## Project Overview

Welcome to Day 21 of the "100 Days of Code: Python" project! This day focuses on creating an advanced version of the classic Snake game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The main goal of this project is to enhance your understanding of OOP by implementing classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

## What I Learned

### Object-Oriented Programming
- **Classes and Objects:** Defined multiple classes to represent different parts of the game, such as the snake, food, and scoreboard.
- **Inheritance:** Used inheritance to create subclasses that extend the functionality of base classes.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulated the game logic within classes to improve modularity and readability.

### Game Development Concepts
- **Game Loop:** Implemented a game loop to continuously update the game state and render graphics on the screen.
- **Collision Detection:** Added logic to detect collisions between the snake and food, as well as the snake and walls or itself.
- **Score Keeping:** Created a scoreboard that updates in real-time based on the player's progress.

## Controls

The Snake game uses keyboard controls for the snake. Use the arrow keys to change the direction of the snake as it moves around the screen.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files:

- `snake_game_part_2.py`: The main script that initializes the game and runs the game loop.
- `snake.py`: Contains the `Snake` class, which handles the movement and behavior of the snake.
- `food.py`: Contains the `Food` class, which generates food at random positions on the screen.
- `scoreboard.py`: Contains the `Scoreboard` class, which keeps track of and displays the player's score.

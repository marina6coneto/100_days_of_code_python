# Day 16: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Coffee Machine Project

This project is part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. On Day 16, I refactored the coffee machine simulation using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python.

This project was developed following the instructions from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course on Udemy.

## Project Overview

The refactored coffee machine project is a console-based application that simulates the behavior of a real coffee machine using classes and objects. The user can choose from different types of coffee, and the program will check if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee. It will also handle monetary transactions and manage resources.

## Features

- Object-oriented design
- Simulation of different types of coffee (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino)
- Resource management (water, milk, coffee)
- Monetary transactions
- Refill and report functions

## Technologies Used

- Python

# Day 11: Blackjack Game Project

This project is part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. On Day 11, I created a simple Blackjack game in Python that allows users to play against the computer.

## Project Overview

The Blackjack game is a console-based application where the user can play a simplified version of Blackjack against the computer. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it, while having a higher score than the dealer.

## Features

- User vs. computer gameplay
- Random card drawing
- Basic Blackjack rules implementation

## Technologies Used

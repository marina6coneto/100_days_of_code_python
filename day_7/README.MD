# Day 7: Hangman Game

This project is an implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game was created as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course.

Hangman is a word-guessing game. The player tries to guess the secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. For each incorrect letter suggested, a part of the "hangman" is drawn. The player wins if they can guess all the letters in the word before the hangman drawing is completed.

## Features

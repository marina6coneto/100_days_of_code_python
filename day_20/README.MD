# Day 20: Snake Game - Part 1

Welcome to Day 20 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp.
Today, we are starting the development of a classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. 

This is part 1 of the project, and we will continue with part 2 on Day 21.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple version of the Snake Game. 
In part 1, we will focus on setting up the game window, creating the snake, and making it move. 
The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys on the keyboard.

## Features

- Create the game window using Turtle.
- Design the initial snake body.

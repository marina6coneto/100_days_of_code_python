This repository contains five HTML files that I worked on during my studies. The files cover basic HTML structures such as links, images, lists, and indentation.

## Files Included

### 1. anchor.html
This file showcases a list of my top 5 favorite websites, using HTML anchor tags to link to external websites.

### 2. birthday_invite.html
This file simulates a birthday invitation with details on the date, a list of items to bring, and a Google Maps link to the event location.

### 3. img.html
This file demonstrates how to use images in HTML. It displays pictures of a puppy and a kitten to represent a "dog person" and a "cat person."

### 4. indentation.html
This file illustrates how to properly indent nested lists in HTML, showing the use of ordered and unordered lists with various levels of nesting.

### 5. index.html 
A simple recipe for cinnamon rolls, showcasing the use of headings, lists, and ordered instructions.

2. Open any of the HTML files in a web browser to view the content.

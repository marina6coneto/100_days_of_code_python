# Day 12: Number Guessing Game Project

This project is part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. On Day 12, I created a number guessing game in Python where the user has to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range.

This project was developed following the instructions from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course on Udemy.

## Project Overview

The number guessing game is a console-based application where the user attempts to guess a randomly generated number. The game provides feedback whether the guessed number is too high or too low, and the user has a limited number of attempts to guess correctly.

## Features

- Random number generation
- User input for guesses
- Feedback on whether guesses are too high or too low
- Limited number of attempts

## Technologies Used

- Python

# Day 14: Higher Lower Game Project

This project is part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. On Day 14, I created a Higher Lower game in Python where the user guesses which of two options has a higher value based on their Instagram follower count.

## Project Overview

The Higher Lower game is a console-based application where the user is presented with two options and has to guess which one has a higher Instagram follower count. The game continues until the user makes an incorrect guess, and the score is tracked throughout the game.

## Features

# Day 5: Password Generator

## Hard Version
This version of the password generator shuffles the characters to create a more secure password.

## How to Run the Hard Version
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Copy the provided Python code into a file (e.g., password_generator_hard.py).
Run the script using a Python interpreter.

## Easy Version
This version of the password generator concatenates the characters sequentially.

## How to Run the Easy Version
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

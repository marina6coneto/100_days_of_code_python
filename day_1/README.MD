# Day 1: Band Name Generator

## Project Description
This is a simple Python script that generates a band name based on the user's inputs. The user is prompted to enter the name of the city they grew up in and the name of their pet. The script then combines these inputs to suggest a potential band name.

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Copy the code below into a Python file (e.g., `band_name_generator.py`).
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

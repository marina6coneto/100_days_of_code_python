# Day 44: Special Moment Poster

- This project is a simple webpage that displays a poster with an image and a motivational message using HTML and CSS.
- The layout of the page is styled with CSS to center the content and give it a clean, elegant look.

## Project Structure
The webpage consists of:
1. A `div` element with the class `poster` that acts as the main container for the content.
2. An image of Daenerys holding an egg as the poster's main visual.
3. A heading (`h1`) for the title "That Special Moment".
4. A paragraph (`p`) that includes the motivational text about finding the perfect avocado.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the elements and positioning the content on the page.
- **Google Fonts**: The 'Libre Baskerville' font is imported from Google Fonts to enhance the visual appeal.

## Key Features
- **DIV Usage**: The `div` with the class `poster` is used as a container for the main content. It is styled with a width of 50% and centered using margin properties.
- **Image Styling**: The image inside the div has a CSS border and is made responsive by setting its width to 100%.
- **Text Styling**: The title is displayed in uppercase, and the font is customized using the 'Libre Baskerville' font from Google Fonts.

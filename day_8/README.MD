# Day 8: Caesar Cipher

This project is an implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption technique in Python. The project was created as part of Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project allows the user to both encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique.

## Features

- Encode messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- Decode messages using the Caesar Cipher.
- User input for the message and shift amount.
- Clear and interactive command-line interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3

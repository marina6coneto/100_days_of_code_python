# Day 19: Turtle Control Script and Turtle Race Simulation

## turtle_control.py

The file 'turtle_control.py' script allows you to control a turtle using the keyboard. The turtle can move forwards, backwards, and turn left or right. You can also clear the screen and reset the turtle's position.

## Controls

- Press `a` to turn left.
- Press `s` to move backwards.
- Press `d` to turn right.

## turtle_race.py

This Python script simulates a race among six turtles using the Turtle graphics library. Users can bet on which turtle they think will win by entering a color from a predefined list. The race results are displayed at the end of the race on the Turtle graphics window.

## Features

- **User Interaction**: Users are prompted to enter their bet on which turtle will win the race.
- **Validation**: Input validation ensures that the user enters a valid color choice.
- **Race Simulation**: Turtles move forward randomly between 0 to 10 units per step until one of them crosses the finish line.
- **Result Display**: Upon race completion, the winner is displayed on the screen based on the user's bet.

# Day 15: Coffee Machine Project

This project is part of the "100 Days of Code" challenge. On Day 15, I created a simulation of a coffee machine in Python.

This project was developed following the instructions from Angela Yu's "100 Days of Code" course on Udemy.

## Project Overview

The coffee machine project is a console-based application that simulates the behavior of a real coffee machine. The user can choose from different types of coffee, and the program will check if there are enough resources to make the selected coffee. It will also handle the monetary transactions.

## Features

- Simulation of different types of coffee (e.g., espresso, latte, cappuccino)
- Resource management (water, milk, coffee)
- Monetary transactions
- Refill and report functions

## Technologies Used

- Python
